🧙 App Overview
Welcome to Gringotts' Wizardry: The Financial Forecasting Spellbook — a Harry Potter–themed machine learning tool for magical stock market forecasting. This interactive Streamlit app turns financial data analysis into a whimsical journey through the wizarding world of Hogwarts.

Users can summon stock data using Yahoo Finance or upload their own scrolls (CSV files), cleanse them with spells like Scourgify, and brew powerful predictive features in Potions Class. Then, by dividing the data with the Sword of Gryffindor, users can train various enchanted models such as Linear Regression, Decision Trees, or Random Forests, and consult the Prophecy Orb for evaluating performance. Finally, the Seer's orb reveals predictions with interactive visualizations and metrics.

Whether you're a muggle or a seasoned sorcerer, this spellbook is your key to mastering financial forecasting in a fun, educational way.
